            <h1>Reflective Essay for the Github cite</h1>
            <p>When designg the Github website, as a new student to the digitial humanities world, the actual HTML code and the CSS code gave
            me the most trouble. I had much difficulty working out bugs as I frequently get error messages that I had no idea how to correct. I also ran
            into issues when it came to exporting changes made to the code from the Oxygen editor. There were many times when I forgot the code
            necessary for "push" process. However, eventually through much trial and error, I was able to figure it out and now those codes are engrained 
            in my brain. I would associate that the main advantage for designing a cite through github, using HTML code would be the style aspect. There
            is must more variability that is possible to design, as the author of the website has complete control over every aspect of their respective
            websites.
