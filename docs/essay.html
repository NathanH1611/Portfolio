                As a new student in the digital humanities world, the actual HTML and CSS code gave
                me the most trouble when designing my websites. I had difficulty working out bugs as I frequently got error messages that I had no idea how to correct. I also ran
                into issues when it came to exporting changes made to the code from the Oxygen editor. There were many times when I forgot the code
                necessary for the "push" process. However, eventually, through much trial and error, I was able to figure it out, and now those codes are engrained 
                in my brain. I would associate that the main advantage of designing a site through git hub would be the total blank canvas that one starts
                with. The author of the site can completely build their website from scratch, allowing them to put whatever information they
                are looking to convey in any format. While designing a site through WordPress, certain themes are given that already have a 
                general output. An example of this would be how WordPress gives a "preview" page that will show an example of the completed website. 
                The most prevalent advantage of WordPress would have to be the ease of the editor. Everything that is needed is readily available and all in 
                one location. This eliminates the need to go back and forth between different editors, like what is done with GitHub. Also, there are real-time updates
                made to the WordPress site while I have found there to be a delay with GitHub. 
                When it comes to modifying the layout of each site, it is easier to change the GitHub site. To change the actual layout of the WordPress site, a 
                different theme has to be selected, which could change the entire website, not just one part. This makes it much more challenging to get a website
                that looks the exact way the author wants. On GitHub, the author has complete control of everything. The best example of this would be the menu
                bar. On WordPress, the author would have to input the appropriate links in a separate editing window. This is then taken and put into an already formatted menu.
                On git hub, the author would have the ability to position the menu wherever they see it fitting best for their website. However, when it comes to modifying the actual 
                body material of each respective website, WordPress is definitely easier as previously mentioned, there is no need to travel between the code editor and the GitHub site. 
                To properly develop both sites, one must be proficient in HTML and CSS coding. This will make life a lot easier, as both sites rely on this to display the information
                the author wants to be seen. I would want to continue to develop my CSS skills. There is an unlimited number of ways that one can customize their website,
                and advancing my CSS skills would unlock a world of possibilities when it comes to customization. If I were to pick one way to design a site in the future, I would probably 
                use WordPress. That is because I feel it is easier for me to navigate. The main downside I see when using WordPress is that there is no autosave feature. I have
                run into this problem, as I have done work on my website, forgot to click "upload" and all my work is gone. However, I enjoyed using both of them and to see my sites
                slowly coming to life was very exciting. I look forward to keeping my site updated and running throughout the years to come.
