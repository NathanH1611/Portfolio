        <h1>Nathan's Super Awesome Website</h1>
        <p>Here are some things about me that you may not have known. I
                <strong>LOVE</strong> sports, specifically baseball. If you are a true fan like me, check out where your favorite <a
                    href="https://www.mlb.com/standings/"> team currently sits!</a>.</p>
        <p>Another fun fact about me, I am a big Penn State fan. That includes both  <a href="https://psblions.com/landing/index">PSUB sports</a>
            <a href="https://gopsusports.com/">and PSU main sports</a>.</p>
        <p>Now a little more about me, I have a very busy life up at Penn State Behrend. I play baseball as a pitcher, which I absoluletly love, and major in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        <h3>My Home Life</h3>
        <p>I grew up on an old farm. This allowed me to live a different life than most of the other kids I was around.
              I would spend alot of my time helping my dad outside doing various chores such as...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Planting apple trees for our apple orchard</li>
            <li>Cutting up and splitting the logs of fallen trees</li>
            <li>Mowing the acres of grass that needed cut every week</li>
            <li>Remulching the landscape every year</li>
            <li>Any other miscellaneous jobs that needed completed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Food</h3>
        <p>The final thing you need to know about me is that I love food, however I am very particular in what I eat.</p>
        <p>When it comes to food, nothing beats my grandma's homecooking, but I love what my Mom and Dad make, too! Here are some of my favorite dishes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My Grandma's white cake with chocolate icing</li>
            <li>My Moms's homemade hamburger helper</li>
            <li>My Grandma's noodles</li>
            <li>A perfectly cooked, medium steak</li>
            <li>My Dad's waffles every Sunday</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I hate spending money on anything except food. So, here are my favorite restaurants:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>City Barbeque</li>
            <li>Chipotle</li>
            <li>Mr. Mikes (Little Hometown Place)</li>
            <li>Texas Roadhouse</li>
            <li>Canes</li>
        </ol>
